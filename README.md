## TODO:

Create a REPL to let you read and write RP2040 registers from a console. You should be able to:

1. select any 32-bit address to read/write (even if not a valid RP2020 address)

1. read/write any 32-bit value to this address

1. read/write using any of the atomic bit-setting aliases and a 32-bit mask

## For this part, we have a main code and a function code:
1. Main code [repl.c](https://github.com/xcyxcyxcyxcy/lab2B-part02/blob/main/code/repl.c)
2. Another code write for read and write functions [register_read&write.c](https://github.com/xcyxcyxcyxcy/lab2B-part02/blob/main/code/register_read%26write.c)

## Finally, we reached the function that we can write value to any address and read it:
