# lab2B-part02
For this part, we have a main code and a function code:
1. Main code [repl.c](https://github.com/xcyxcyxcyxcy/lab2B-part02/blob/main/code/repl.c)
2. Another code write for read and write functions [register_read&write.c](https://github.com/xcyxcyxcyxcy/lab2B-part02/blob/main/code/register_read%26write.c)

Finally, we reached the function that we can write value to any address and read it:
<div class="box">
        <img src="https://github.com/xcyxcyxcyxcy/lab2B-part02/blob/main/screen.png" />
</div>
